       Credits (Sound)

  --All of the sounds belong to their rightful owners at "freesound.org".
    The following is a list of all sounds used and their rightful owners. 

    "explosion.wav" - "waterxplo.wav" by inferno
    "bleep.wav" - "8-bit Coin.aif" by timgormly

    "underwater.wav" - "underwater" by yosarrian

  --The majority of these sounds were edited through Audacity 2.0. Both my
    sounds and their sounds are all under the creative commons license and
    are therefore of fair use.

      Credits (Font)
------------------------------

  --All fonts were retrieved from "dafont.com" and are  also under the creative
    commons license.

    "jawbreaker.fnt" - "Jawbreaker" by Ã†nigma
    "le fish.fnt" - "Le Fish" by zanatlija

  --The fish font was used for somes of the fish in the background. If you
    want, you can take mine.

------------------------------
      Credits (Sprites)
------------------------------

  --The majority of the sprites I used were drawn by me in Inkscape and GIMP.
    Only one was pulled from the internet.

    "explosion_spritesheet.png" was pulled from Google Images under the
    creative commons filter. It was originally a gif and was edited through
    GIMP to become a spritesheet. I do not know who is the author of the
    explosion. If you are, email me at "emailqasim@gmail.com".

  --Again, all sprites are under creative commons and are therefore free for
    you to use at your leisure. Credit me any time you use any of these
    sprites.
